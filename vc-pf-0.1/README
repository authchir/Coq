Dependencies
------------

- Coq (http://coq.inria.fr), tested with version 8.4 pl 5
- GHC (https://www.haskell.org/ghc/), tested with version 7.6.3

Platforms
---------

Tested using Ubuntu 14.04 using stock ghc and coq packages and under
MacOS 10.10 using stock ghc and coq installations.

Running
-------

If you have GNU make or similar, just run make. This creates the
executables "FPTPWrapper" and "STVWrapper". Run "make test" to test
both on randomly generated data. See the last section of the Haskell
source files of the wrappers on how to use both interactively from
within ghc.
